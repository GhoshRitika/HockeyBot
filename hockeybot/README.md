## **Description**
The Franka robot will be playing air hockey. A camera will be used to detect where
the puck is on the air hockey table and get the velocity of the puck, predict where itâ€™s going, and
tell the Franka to meet the puck there.

## **User Guide**
1. Make sure ROS packages are most recent and up-to-date
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

```
2.  Git clone `git@github.com:ME495-EmbeddedSystems/hw3group-HockeyBot.git` into the /src directory of the customer workspace. 	This file will install the ros dependencies required to run this project.
3. The `hockeybot` package contains the following nodes:
* `main`:  This node receives data from the CV node to be passed into the trajectory
    calculations node (Traj_Calc). It also receives the calculations back from Traj_Calc for
    additional processing to ultimately be passed into the SimpleMove API.
* `cam_node`: Use computer vision to detect puck and table frame, and send data to Main node.
* `traj_calc`:
